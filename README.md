# AdmiralBumbleBot

A silly Discord utility bot for [AdmiralBumbleBee's](http://admiralbumblebee.com) [Discord server](https://discord.gg/phMMJ8Q). Server members are more than welcome to contribute by raising issues, requesting features, or contributing code under these conditions:

* Let me (`@porksausages#6738`) know about what you're working on via Discord, preferably before submitting a PR - it would be a shame to have to decline a pull request that somebody has worked hard on just because it adds a feature to the bot that we don't want.
* Where possible, extend by adding new code in it's own file, rather than changing existing code. If you want to make significant changes to the existing codebase, please raise an issue or speak to me on Discord first.
* Please don't add unreliable/pre v1.0 dependencies for anything important without speaking to me first.
